### notes

<command name><TAB><key name>.. doesn't apply to the stats command
Strange requirements on KV store? (max file size etc)
String based protocol but not encoding
Homegrown K/V store, why not Casandra etc?
Low level byte oriented protocol. Why not protobuf et al?
All network protocols should (must?) start with a version byte.
